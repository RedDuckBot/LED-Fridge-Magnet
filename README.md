# LED Fridge Magnet
Honey comb, LED fridge magnet designed with a simple custom PCB. The top and base covers are 3D printed while the centered 
soft pine piece with the engraved bee was CNC cut, as well as the white hexagon pieces, for hiding the LEDs, which were cutout out of a white acrylic sheet. The gerber files for the PCB and the 3D print files have all been provided.

The circuit is quite simple where each board had six LEDs wired in parallel and powered by a CR2032 lithium ion button battery.
